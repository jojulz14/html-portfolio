<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! I am Mark Aguilar and I'm a web developer with a passion for creating responsive and user-friendly websites. 
   <br>I specialize in front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. I'm also familiar 
   <br>with back-end tools such as Node.js and Express. I enjoy turning design ideas into real products and constantly  
   <br>learning new technologies to improve my craft.
</p>

<p>In every project, I focus on writing clean, efficient code and delivering smooth user experiences. I'm driven by curiosity 
   <br>and a desire to grow, always open to learning from others and embracing new challenges. Whether working independently or in a 
   <br>team setting, I aim to build web applications that are not only functional but also impactful and engaging.
</p>
